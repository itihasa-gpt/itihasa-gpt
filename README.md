# Project Vision
Our goal is to create LLM models trained on a corpora of historical Indian texts.

# TODO

1. Set up pipelines to convert OCR data into PDFs that can be fed into LLMs
2. Set up storage for PDFs
2. Set up self service platform for contributors to submit digitized primary source Indian documents/manuscripts/inscriptions indexed by location and time period


# Contribution Requests

We are requesting volunteers who are working on digitizing records from Indian archives to contribute historical Indian records, manuscripts, inscriptions, and other primary source documents to the self service platform so that they can be ingested and used for training our models


# Contribution Guide
TBA
